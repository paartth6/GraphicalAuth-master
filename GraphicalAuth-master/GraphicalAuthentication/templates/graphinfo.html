            <h5>What is Graphical Authentication?</h5>
        </div>
        <div class="ans">
            <p>A graphical password is an authentication system that works by having the user select from images, in 
                a specific order, presented in a graphical user interface (GUI). For this reason, the graphical-password 
                approach is called graphical user authentication (GUA). The most common computer authentication method is 
                to use alphanumerical usernames and passwords. This method has been shown to have significant 
                disadvantages. For e.g, users tend to choose passwords that can be easily guessed. On the other hand, if a 
                password is difficult to guess, then it is often difficult to remember. To overcome this problem of low security, 
                Authentication methods are developed by researchers that use images as password. In this research paper, we 
                conduct a comprehensive survey of the existing graphical password techniques and provide a possible theory 
                of our own. Graphical password schemes have been proposed as a possible alternative to text-based schemes,
                by the fact that humans can remember pictures better than text; Pictures are generally easier to be remembered 
                or recognized than text</p>

                <h5>Why Graphical Authentication?</h5>
            </div>
            <div class="ans">
                <p>In a graphical password authentication system, the user has to select from images, 
                    in a specific order, presented to them in a graphical user interface (GUI). 
                    According to a study, the human brain has a greater capability of remembering 
                    what they see(pictures) rather than alphanumeric characters. Therefore, 
                    graphical passwords overcome the disadvantage of alphanumeric passwords. Graphical 
                    Password Authentication has three major categories based on the activity they use 
                    for authentication of the password:<br><br>
                    Recognition based Authentication: A user is given a set of images 
                    and he has to identify the image he selected during registration.
                    For example, Passfaces is a graphical password scheme based on 
                    recognizing human faces. During password creation, users are given a large set 
                    of images to select from. To log in, users have to identify the pre-selected 
                    image from the several images presented to him.<br><br>
                    Recall based Authentication: A user is asked to reproduce something that he 
                    created or selected at the registration stage. For example, in the Passpoint 
                    scheme, a user can click any point in an image to create the password and a 
                    tolerance around each pixel is calculated. During authentication, the user 
                    has to select the points within the tolerance in the correct sequence to login.<br><br>
                    Cued Recall: Cued Click Points (CCP) is an alternative to the PassPoints technique. 
                    In CCP, users click one point on each image rather than on five points on one image 
                    (unlike PassPoints). It offers cued-recall and instantly alerts the users if they 
                    make a mistake while entering their latest click-point.</p>
